I am a Masters Student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania working with Professor Konrad Kording. I am also a research assistant under Professor Valentina Assenova at The Wharton School.

### Research Interests

I am very interested in applying Deep Learning to Graphs and Networks. I believe graph signal processing and deep learning could go hand-in-hand one day.

I also have experience in Computer Vision, Signal Processing, and Compressive Sensing.
