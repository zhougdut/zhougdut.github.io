- **Journal paper.** _Oct 2013_. In Neuroimage, we present a method to spatiotemporally and spectrally characterize the dynamics of brain oscillations in resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data at the group level [paper](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ahyvarin/papers/Ramkumar14.pdf).
- **Invited talk.** _Aug 2013_. I visited [Center for Neuroscience](http://www.cns.iisc.ernet.in/index.html) at the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, and gave a talk titled: Building Marr's bridges — linking islands of computational, algorithmic, and mechanistic descriptions of behavior, mind and brain [slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/25y150nqchlrtow/Ramkumar_July2013_IISc_Bangalore.pdf?dl=0).
- **Invited talk.** _June 2013_. At Neurospin, Gif Sur Yvette, I gave a talk about decoding visual information from single-trial MEG data. Thanks to Alexandre Gramfort at ParisTech for the invitation [slides]().

- **Poster.** _VSS, May 2013_. I presented some predictions of primate gaze locations in a natural scene search task based on computational models of priority maps. Our main result is that visual features of fixated locations enroute to the target show a weak but significant bias towards target orientation [<i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i> poster](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4521272/Ramkumar_VSS2013.pdf)
- **Journal paper.** _May 2013_. In Journal of Neuroscience, we report successful time-resolved decoding of low-level visual features — orientation, spatial frequency and direction of rotation — of large gratings, from single-trial MEG data. Our results constitute primary data on the timing of information processing in human visual cortex. [<i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i> paper](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/18/7691.full.pdf+html)
- **Journal paper.** _March 2013_. In Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, we present a method to reject and cluster independent component clusters obtained from multi-subject resting-state fMRI data, based on a principled null hypothesis. [paper])
