### Bio

I'm an MD/PhD student at NU working on my PhD research after having completed the first two years of medical school. I studied physics at the University of Texas at Austin where I worked on projects involving molecular motor biophysics, molecular imaging, and auditory neuroscience. During my PhD, I've mainly been building models to understand neural activity.

### Research Interests

I'm interested in using computational and statistical tools to solve problems in biology and medicine, especially in neuroscience. I enjoy collaborating with other groups - no problem is too strange!

<hr>

### Current projects

1. Visual search: behavior, electrophysiology, and modeling
2. Models of single-trial dynamics in spike trains
3. Correlations and connectivity during associative learning
4. Computational approaches to cancer
5. Health care informatics
