I do biological and computational investigations of the visuomotor system. Currently pursuing two directions:

1. WTFEF? Trying to decipher the frontal eye fields. Our current approach is to record from many FEF cells while monkeys search for targets in natural scenes.
2. Investigating the role of the tectoreticulospinal tract during reflexive orienting. Super excited about this, but it is still very much in development stages. More details later.


**Bio:** Proud American/Canadian dual citizen. Former session guitarist. I miss living near mountains. Wannabe sailor. I like snakes, especially viperidae. Hate goats. Fascinated by Polynesian history. Spent 2 yrs in Dominican Republic as a LDS missionary. Studied philosophy (primarily existential phenomenology) during my undergrad. Blissfully married, with one perfect daughter and one lazy weimaraner named Darwin.
