**Research Interests**

I'm interested in using computational neuroscience to understand electrophysiological signals. In other words, if you give me an electrical recording from the brain, I want to (someday) be able to tell you about the underlying biology, network activity, cognition, and pathology underlying it. Additionally, I'm interested in algorithmic approaches to knowledge generation and validation. For instance, I built a discovery engine that can generate gene/function relationship hypotheses based on their spatial correlations in the human brain [here](https://github.com/voytekresearch/nsaba/blob/master/notebooks/demos/Nsaba_Long_Demo.ipynb)

**Stuff I do**

> Programming in Python and MATLAB

> Digital signal processing

> Statistics and Machine Learning, slowly figuring out deep learning

> "Data Science"

<br>

**Stuff I've Done**

I've written some tutorials on basic approaches to electrophysiological analyses [here](https://github.com/voytekresearch/tutorials)
Occasionally I blog about neuroscience and data science [here](https://neurosciencebro.blogspot.com)

Someday I might even publish a paper.
