### About

I am broadly interested in the application of machine learning and data science methods to augment or improve life. I am currently working on quantifying patient outcomes in clinical rehabilitation using wearables and smartphones data. The overarching goal of this research is to: 1) provide clinicians with quantitative data to tailor rehabilitation programs; 2) understand the benefits of new rehab technologies in terms of functional recovery (e.g. does an advanced prosthetic leg allow a patient to walk more?).

I received my MSc in Biomedical Engineering from University Campus Bio-medico of Rome, Italy and my PhD in Computer Science from Goethe University of Frankfurt, Germany.

During my MSc I worked on a model of the [acquisition and retention of motor tasks](http://dspace.mit.edu/openaccess-disseminate/1721.1/55996) to optimize robotic neuro-rehabilitation (in collaboration with the [Newman Lab at MIT](http://newmanlab.mit.edu/)). Throughout my PhD I worked on a method for [unsupervised learning of active stereo-vision](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3819528/) on the humanoid robot iCub using Sparse Coding and Reinforcement Learning. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuA6OU2VdhE&feature=youtu.be) of the result.

_Using wearable accelerometers to detect everyday activities in patients walking with a leg brace_<br>

Walking assistive devices are useful when they enable individuals with disabilities to function better in daily life. Here we use machine learning to identify functional daily activities from wearable sensors data. Such measurement of daily activities can inform clinicians and researchers on the effectiveness of novel assistive devices. Since different assistive devices are used by each individual, we investigate whether we need to train brace-specific, patient-specific or population-specific activity recognition classifiers.

_Fall detection in lower limb amputees using mobile phones_<br>

<figure><center>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/others/Falls.png" width="500">
</center></figure>

Falls are a common occurrence in the elderly and people with lower-limb amputations, and amongst elderly are the primary cause of injury-related death. Detecting falls and understanding the context where they happen can guide prevention strategies as well as alerting emergency services automatically when needed. Here we train machine learning classifiers to detect falls from mobile phones inertial and GPS sensors data. We train our classifiers using in-lab collected data on simulated falls and test our models on data continuously collected on patients and able-bodied individuals during their daily activities.

_Automatic Detection of Spasticity in individuals with Stroke_<br>

<figure><center>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/others/Spasticity2.jpg" width="500">
</center></figure>

Spasticity is a common set of symptoms in individuals who had a neural injury. It can results in muscle stiffness or uncontrollable arm or leg movements, which can strongly limit everyday activities. Most information on spasticity symptoms is obtained through patient self-report or from in-lab exams, which require dedicated lab equipment and trained clinicians. Using data from flexible wearable EMG sensors, we are working on the automatic classification of the electrical activity of muscles into normal and spastic, with the ultimate goal of long-term quantitative monitoring of such condition.
