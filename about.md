### About us
We are the research group in Guangdong University of Technology, focus on matrix/tensor decomposition for machine learning  and signal processing. Recently, we are also interesting in deep learning.

### Research

A tensor could be viewed as a multi-index nuerical array, where the order of a tensor denote the number of its order. In real-world applications, many observation data could be presented as tensor, for example image could be presented as second order tensor, video could be viewed as third order tensor and EEG data could be presented as forth order tensor. Tensor decomposition aims to explore the low-dimensional representations without destroying the internal structure of tensor data.
